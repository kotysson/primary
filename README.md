# My project
## Description

So, here's the first **git.thing.whatever** that I've created! Currently, I have no idea that I'm gonna do here, but I can say for sure that before September serious-level programming was perhaps one of the last things I thought about. So here's to the new start and... *cheers!*

## Homework
I will create a separate folder with homework (HW) to ease the orientation in git space.

## Work in class
The "Aud" folder will contain files.py with code written in class.

## Useless table
Just to check that I've learned to create tables in md.

| column1   | column2 | column3 |
| -------   | ------- | ------- |
| seems yep |  nope   |yep again|

## My inspiration
Who could I thank for ever deciding to go all python?
<p>Huawei, Eagel team and my amazing colleagues who gave my first Python classes right during work hours!</p>
